# Java for All

Welcome to **Java for All**, a comprehensive repository for learning Java step by step! ðŸš€

## Loops in Java
Loops in Java allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met. This helps in reducing redundant code and making programs more efficient.

### **1. For Loop**
The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```
**Output:**
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

### **2. While Loop**
The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is **not known in advance** and depends on a condition.
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
}
```

### **3. Do-While Loop**
The `do-while` loop ensures that the loop body executes **at least once**, even if the condition is false.
```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

### **Basic Questions Covered:**
âœ” Print numbers from 1 to N using different loops.
âœ” Find the sum of first N natural numbers.
âœ” Reverse a number using a loop.
âœ” Print patterns using nested loops.
