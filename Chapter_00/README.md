# Java for All

## Introduction
Welcome to **Java for All**! This repository is designed to cover **everything you need to know about Java**, from the basics to advanced concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this course will help you understand Java in depth.

## What is Java?
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It is widely used for building enterprise applications, mobile applications (Android), web applications, and more.

### Key Features of Java
- **Platform Independent**: Java code runs on any platform with the help of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
- **Secure**: Java provides security features like bytecode verification and memory management.
- **Multithreaded**: Supports multiple threads for better performance.
- **Robust and Scalable**: Java has strong memory management and exception handling features.

## History of Java
- **1991**: Java project started by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton.
- **1995**: Java 1.0 was officially released.
- **2006**: Sun Microsystems made Java open-source under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
- **2010**: Oracle Corporation acquired Java after purchasing Sun Microsystems.
- **Present**: Java continues to evolve with new features and improvements.

## JDK, JRE, and JVM
### 1. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
JVM is an abstract machine that enables Java programs to be executed on any device. It converts Java bytecode into machine code for execution.

### 2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**
JRE contains libraries and JVM required to run Java applications. It does **not** include development tools like compilers.

### 3. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
JDK is a complete package that includes JRE + development tools like compiler (`javac`), debugger, and other utilities for developing Java applications.

## What Type of Language is Java?
Java is:
- **Compiled and Interpreted**: Java code is compiled into bytecode and then interpreted by JVM.
- **Strongly Typed**: Every variable and expression has a defined data type.
- **Object-Oriented**: Follows principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- **General-Purpose**: Can be used for web, mobile, desktop, and embedded applications.

## Java Editions
Java is available in different editions for various applications:
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)** â€“ Core Java used for desktop and server-side applications.
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)** â€“ Used for large-scale enterprise applications.
- **Java ME (Micro Edition)** â€“ Used for embedded and mobile applications.
- **JavaFX** â€“ Used for building rich graphical user interfaces (GUI).
