# Java for All (JFA) - SpecialQuestion

This folder **SpecialQuestion** contains two major implementations in Java using packages:
1. **`shape` Package** - Implements various geometric shape classes (Rectangle, Square, Cylinder, Sphere) and provides methods to calculate area, perimeter, and volume.
2. **`Calculator` Package** - Implements basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `sec`, `cosec`).

## ðŸ“‚ 1. `shape` Package - Geometric Calculations

### **ðŸ”¹ Classes in `shape` Package**
- **`Square`** â†’ Calculates the area of a square.
- **`Rectangle`** â†’ Calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
- **`Cylinder`** â†’ Calculates the area and volume of a cylinder.
- **`Sphere`** â†’ Calculates the area and volume of a sphere.

## ðŸ“‚ 2. `Calculator` Package - Arithmetic & Trigonometry Operations

### **ðŸ”¹ Classes in `Calculator` Package**
- **`BasicOperations`** â†’ Implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **`Trigonometry`** â†’ Implements trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `sec`, `cosec`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
- The **`shape` package** provides geometric calculations for common shapes.
- The **`Calculator` package** provides both basic arithmetic and trigonometric functions.
- Both packages demonstrate the **use of Java packages, encapsulation, and method usage.**

### **ðŸ“Œ Special Thanks**
Special thanks to [**Code with Harry**](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) for his Java tutorials that helped in understanding these concepts.

ðŸ’¡ **Enhancement Idea:** Try adding more geometric figures or mathematical operations to make this project even better! ðŸš€
