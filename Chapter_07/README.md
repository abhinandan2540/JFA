## 📌 **Understanding Java Methods**  

### 🔹 What are Methods?  
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in reusability, reducing code duplication, and improving readability.  

### 🔹 Defining a Method  
A method is declared using the following syntax:  

```java
returnType methodName(parameters) {  
    // method body  
}
```

Example:  
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {  
    return a + b;  
}
```

### 🔹 Calling a Method  
A method is called using the method name followed by parentheses:  

```java
int sum = add(5, 10);  // Calling the add method
```

### 🔹 Method Overloading  
Java allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This is called **method overloading**.  

Example:  
```java
public void display(int a) {  
    System.out.println("Integer: " + a);  
}  

public void display(String s) {  
    System.out.println("String: " + s);  
}
```

### 🔹 Recursion in Java  
A recursive method is a method that calls itself to solve a problem.  

Example:  
```java
public int factorial(int n) {  
    if (n == 0)  
        return 1;  
    return n * factorial(n - 1);  
}
```
