# Java for All

Welcome to **Java for All** â€“ a complete Java course designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master Java programming. This repository covers fundamental to advanced concepts, with a focus on hands-on coding and problem-solving.

## String Methods in Java

Java provides a rich set of built-in string methods to manipulate and process text efficiently. Some of the most commonly discussed string methods in this repository include:

- **length()**: Returns the length of the string.
- **charAt(index)**: Returns the character at the specified index.
- **substring(start, end)**: Extracts a portion of the string.
- **contains(str)**: Checks if the string contains a specific sequence.
- **toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()**: Converts the string to uppercase/lowercase.
- **trim()**: Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.
- **split(delimiter)**: Splits the string based on the given delimiter and returns an array.
- **replace(oldChar, newChar)**: Replaces occurrences of a character or substring.
- **indexOf(char)**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character.
- **equals() / equalsIgnoreCase()**: Compares two strings for equality.

For a more detailed explanation and practical applications of these methods, please check out the full repository.
