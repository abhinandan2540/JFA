# Java for All

Welcome to **Java for All** â€“ a complete Java course designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master Java programming. This repository covers fundamental to advanced concepts, with a focus on hands-on coding and problem-solving.

## Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types

### **Primitive Data Types**
Primitive data types in Java are the basic building blocks of data manipulation. They include:

- **byte** (1 byte) â€“ Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127.
- **short** (2 bytes) â€“ Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767.
- **int** (4 bytes) â€“ Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- **long** (8 bytes) â€“ Stores very large whole numbers.
- **float** (4 bytes) â€“ Stores fractional numbers (single precision, 6-7 decimal digits).
- **double** (8 bytes) â€“ Stores fractional numbers (double precision, 15-16 decimal digits).
- **char** (2 bytes) â€“ Stores a single character.
- **boolean** (1 bit) â€“ Stores `true` or `false` values.

### **Non-Primitive Data Types**
Non-primitive data types are more complex and include:

- **String** â€“ A sequence of characters.
- **Arrays** â€“ A collection of elements of the same data type.
- **Classes** â€“ User-defined blueprints for objects.
- **Interfaces** â€“ Abstract types that specify method signatures without implementation.
- **Objects** â€“ Instances of classes that contain state and behavior.

## Practice Questions for Deeper Understanding
To help reinforce these concepts, I have included some questions that will test your understanding of primitive and non-primitive data types. Solving these questions will improve your grasp of Java's type system and memory management.
