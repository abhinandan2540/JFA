# Java for All (JFA)

## Introduction
Welcome to **Java for All (JFA)**! This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering Java, covering various essential concepts in depth. The focus here is on **Inheritance in Java**, a core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle that allows code reusability and modularity.

## 📌 **Inheritance in Java**
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to acquire the properties and behavior of another class. It helps in reducing redundancy and improving code structure.

### 🔹 **Types of Inheritance**
1. **Single Inheritance** – A child class inherits from a single parent class.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance** – A child class inherits from a parent class, which itself inherits from another class.
3. **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)** – Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes but allows it through interfaces.

### 🔹 **Method Overriding**
- When a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
- Enables **Runtime Polymorphism**.
- Requires the `@Override` annotation.

### 🔹 **Super Keyword**
- Used to refer to the parent class methods and constructors.
- Helps in calling the overridden methods of the parent class.

### 🔹 **Dynamic Method Dispatch**
- A technique where a parent class reference variable is used to refer to a child class object.
- The method call is resolved at runtime based on the object type.

### 🔹 **Constructors in Inheritance**
- The parent class constructor is executed before the child class constructor.
- `super()` is used to call the parent class constructor explicitly.

### 🔹 **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**
- **Abstract Classes**: Cannot be instantiated and may have both abstract and concrete methods.
- **Interfaces**: Used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java, containing only abstract methods (before Java 8) or default/static methods (from Java 8 onward).
