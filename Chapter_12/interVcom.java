           Programming languages are categorized based on how their code is translated into machine code that a computer can execute.
            The two main categories are Interpreted Languages and Compiled Languages.

            1. Interpreted Language
            2. Compiled Language

          1. Interpreted Language:
            An interpreted language is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime,
            meaning the code is translated and executed simultaneously.

            Character :
           1.  Code runs without a separate compilation step.
           2. Slower execution compared to compiled languages since translation happens during runtime.
           3. Easier debugging because execution stops immediately at an error.
           4. Cross-platform compatibility (as long as an interpreter is available).

           Example :
           python, javascript, php ruby

         2. Compiled Language:
           A compiled language is first converted into machine code by a compiler before execution.
            The compiled program (binary executable) is then run separately.

            Character :
            1. Code is compiled into a separate executable file before running.
            2. Faster execution since translation happens before runtime.
            3. Harder debugging since errors are found after compilation.
            4. Optimized for performance.

            Example :
            c,c++,java ( hybrid ), Go
