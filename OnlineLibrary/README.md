# Java for All (JFA)

Welcome to **Java for All (JFA)**! 🚀 This repository is a collection of Java programs covering fundamental and advanced concepts.

## 📌 Library Management System

This repository includes two implementations of a **Library Management System** demonstrating different approaches to handling dynamic data:

### **1️⃣ Using Java Arrays**

The first version of the **Library Management System** is implemented using a **simple Java array**.

#### ✨ **Key Features in Java Array Version:**

- Uses a **fixed-size array** to store book records.
- Books are **issued** by marking them as `"null"` in the array.
- Books are **returned** by replacing `"null"` with the book name.
- Simple traversal using `for` loops.

#### 🛑 **Limitations of Java Arrays:**

- **Fixed size** – Once declared, the size cannot be changed.
- **Manual shifting** – Removing or adding elements requires extra handling.
- **Inefficient memory usage** – Unused slots waste space.

### **2️⃣ Using Java ArrayList**

The second version leverages **Java's `ArrayList`**, which dynamically manages book records.

#### ✨ **Key Features in Java ArrayList Version:**

- Uses `ArrayList<String>` for storing book records dynamically.
- Supports **adding and removing** books easily.
- Books are **issued** by removing them from the list.
- Books are **returned** by adding them back dynamically.



#### ✅ **Advantages of ArrayList over Arrays:**

- **Dynamic resizing** – No need to predefine size.
- **Easy insertions & deletions** – `remove()` and `add()` simplify operations.
- **Efficient memory management** – Uses only the required space.

## 💡 **Concepts Covered**

📌 **Java Arrays** – Fixed-size, indexed storage.\
📌 **Java ArrayList** – Dynamic lists with flexible storage.\
📌 **For Loops & Enhanced For Loops** – Iterating through data.\
📌 **Conditional Statements** – `if-else` checks for availability.\
📌 **String Manipulation** – Handling book names efficiently.
