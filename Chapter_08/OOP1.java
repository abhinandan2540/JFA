/*
 important:
By declaring PrintDetails() as public void, we make it an instance method.

This means the method belongs to an object (an instance of the class), not the class itself.
Since id and name are instance variables, they also belong to the object.
If we declare PrintDetails() as static, it becomes a class method.

Static methods belong to the class, not any specific object.
Since id and name are instance variables, they do not belong to the class itself, only to individual objects.
A static method cannot directly access instance variables like id and name because they belong to an instance, which static methods donâ€™t have.
Since id and name are part of an object, PrintDetails() must also be an instance method so that it can access them.
