# Java for All

Welcome to **Java for All** â€“ a complete Java course designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master Java programming. This repository covers fundamental to advanced concepts, with a focus on hands-on coding and problem-solving.

## Operators and Expressions in Java

### **Operators in Java**
Operators in Java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands and return a result. Java provides several types of operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (Modulus)
- **Relational (Comparison) Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`
- **Unary Operators**: `+`, `-`, `++` (Increment), `--` (Decrement)
- **Ternary Operator**: `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`
- **Instanceof Operator**: Used to test if an object is an instance of a specific class.

### **Expressions in Java**
Expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that are evaluated to produce a result. Some examples include:

- **Arithmetic Expression**: `int sum = a + b;`
- **Boolean Expression**: `boolean result = (x > y) && (y < z);`
- **Assignment Expression**: `x += 5;`
- **Method Call Expression**: `System.out.println("Hello");`

Understanding operators and expressions is essential for writing efficient Java programs.

## Practice Questions for Deeper Understanding
